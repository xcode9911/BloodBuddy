# BloodBuddy Repository

**BloodBuddy** is a mobile app designed to connect blood donors and gainers in emergency situations. It allows donors to register and offer blood while gainers can search for blood donors based on location and blood type. The app includes an interactive chat feature, allowing gainers to communicate with donors directly. BloodBuddy uses location-based filtering to connect users with nearby donors, primarily focusing on cities in Nepal with major hospitals.
